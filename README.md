Diabetes Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This project leverages machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression,
to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical diagnostic features. 
The dataset includes various health metrics like glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more.
The goal is to build an accurate and interpretable model for early diabetes detection.

🚀 Features
Predicts the likelihood of diabetes using logistic regression.
Preprocessing of medical data, including handling missing values and scaling.
Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
User-friendly web interface for data input and predictions (if applicable).
